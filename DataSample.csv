The hand gesture recognition device includes at least one sensitised area 25 for detecting a hand gesture, an input/output device positioned in the passenger compartment for selecting or creating at least one pattern gesture which can be recognised by the sensitised area 25 and a gesture recognition module for transmitting an authorised code signal to the security device 23 upon recognition of the selected or created gesture over the sensitised area. Such a gesture pattern can easily be modified from the I/O device by the user and ensure an improved security to a conventional keyless entry system.","Abbey Road Whitley,Coventry CV3 4LF",59.0,Jaguar Land Rover,28230.0,JAGUAR CARS LIMITED,2012,Jaguar Land Rover,"Control, Transport","ImRec, CyberSec",8.0,33782471.0,Jaguar Land Rover,UKD,UKD61,North West,Warrington,C,29.0,29100.0,MANUFACTURING,"Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",Manufacture of motor vehicles,1

The electronic key has an electronic controller (29), a first receiver (25) for receiving an authentication signal, and a first transmitter (25) for transmitting a signal. The electronic key further comprises a data connector (31) for establishing a wired connection with a data port (33, 43) on the vehicle. Power may also be transferred between the electronic key and the remote access system when the key is docked in the data port. A challenge-response authentication procedure may be conducted when the electronic key is inserted into the data port. Data ports may be provided on the exterior of the vehicle, for granting entry to the vehicle, and interior of the vehicle, for controlling engine start after an authentication process. The vehicle has a controller, transmitter and receiver, for exchanging authentication signals with the electronic key and controlling access to the vehicle, in addition to the data ports. The direct wired connection between the key and the vehicle remote access system provides a back-up when wireless communication is not possible.",,28.0,Jaguar Land Rover,28230.0,Jaguar Cars Limited,2013,Jaguar Land Rover,"Control, Transport",CyberSec,8.0,33782471.0,Jaguar Land Rover,UKD,UKD61,North West,Warrington,C,29.0,29100.0,MANUFACTURING,"Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",Manufacture of motor vehicles,1

The steering wheel position 13 and steering wheel speed 14 are input to a calculation module 15 which provides an output 16 that is input with the lateral acceleration 11 to a calculation module 12. Calculation module 12 provides a conditioned or modified characteristic of lateral acceleration 17 which is used to trigger the active device if the conditioned lateral acceleration 17 exceeds a threshold lateral acceleration. Steering wheel position is represented by an angular departure from a reference position which is preferable a straight ahead. A look-up table is used to determine a steering wheel position signal and an algorithm is used to link steering wheel position and steering wheel speed.",,5.0,Jaguar Land Rover,29100.0,Jaguar Cars Limited,2011,Jaguar Land Rover,Transport,MachLearn,8.0,33782471.0,Jaguar Land Rover,UKD,UKD61,North West,Warrington,C,29.0,29100.0,MANUFACTURING,"Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers",Manufacture of motor vehicles,1
